📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict airline profitability using a machine learning model trained on historical flight performance data. By leveraging various operational features such as flight delays, aircraft utilization, load factor, fleet availability, maintenance downtime, fuel efficiency, revenue, and operating costs, the model provides insights to optimize airline operations.

🚀 Key Features & Technologies

Machine Learning Model: Trained using Random Forest Regressor.

Preprocessing Pipeline: Handles categorical encoding, feature scaling, and missing data imputation.

Deployment: Interactive Streamlit web application.

Tools & Libraries: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Joblib, and Streamlit.

⚙️ Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:


Run the Streamlit Application

streamlit run app.py

🏢 Department-Specific Focus

Explain the approach used for data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training.

Provide clear steps for replicating the model and evaluating its performance.

Include metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² to showcase model accuracy.
